    "- **-p** : these are port mappings, indicating that Docker should forward information going in and out of port 27017 from the Neo4j container to port 27017 on your local machine\n",
    "- **--mount** : takes the persistent volume named `mongodb_volume` and mounts it into the /data folder inside of the container; this is where the database's data and settings will get stored\n",
    "- **-e**: environment variables that get passed to the database's configuration file on startup; these variables are required to make sure plugins will run correctly\n",
    "- At the very end of the command, you'll notice we list **mongo:4.0** as the final argument.  This specifies the Docker image and version to run inside of the container, and will download and launch MongoDB version 4.0 (the most current version as of this writing).  If newer versions are available, you can specify `mongo:latest` to get the most recent version of MongoDB.\n",

To use the client, download the **Mongo Compass app** from the [MongoDB download center](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#compass).  Be sure to choose the version of the app that matches the operating system on your local computer.  Once that's downloaded, enter the connection credentials as follows, then click \"Connect\":\n",

    "![MongoDB Compass connect app](img_mongodb/mongodb_compass_connect.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method #2: mongo shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way to connect to the MongoDB database is via the command line, using the **mongo shell**.  To start off, run the following command that allows you to enter the Docker container and access a bash shell within the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker exec -it mongodb /bin/bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "mongo --host localhost:27017\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that neither of these approaches requires you to authenticate or set a username or password.  This is because MongoDB runs in a kind of \"demo mode\" by default, where authentication features are diabled.  You will need to enable an authentication method and take other security precautions to secure the database installation if you want to use MongoDB in a production environment."

A **collection** is a set of documents--in this case, tweets--that are stored together within a database.  If you are familiar with relational databases, you can think of a collection as being similar to a \"table\" in a relational database system.  The primary difference between a \"collection\" and a \"table\" is that collections don't enforce any kind of tabular data structure when storing your data.  Unlike rows in a table, which must be structured according to a pre-defined set of attributes/columns, documents in a collection can contain irregularly-shaped values (ex: arrays, dictionaries), missing values, and are just generally more flexible in their structure than tables generally are.\n",
