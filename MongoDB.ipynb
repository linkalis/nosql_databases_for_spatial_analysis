So, to query information about users' follower counts, you would search on the field: `'user.follower_count'`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* $nin: not in\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at some sample questions and how you can query for answers in MongoDB.  To help you get started, the Mongo Compass app has a \"Filter\" interface that lets you write simple queries and return the results directly within the app.  To run the queries below, simply paste them into your Mongo Compass app's \"Filter\" box and hit \"Enter\" to return the results.\n",

Click into the \"Explain Plan\" tab in the Mongo Compass app, then run the query again to get information on how the query is being executed behind the scenes:\n",

    "![Mongo Compass explain plan without index](img_mongodb/mongodb_explain_plan_no_index.png)\n",

    "If to look at the \"Documents Examined\" information, it looks like the query has to examine _every single document_ in the database before it is able to return a result!  Why?  Well, the warning icon at the end of the \"Query Performance Summary\" box gives you a hint: there is \"no index available\" that helps this query run faster.  Without an index on the followers_count values, the database has to search through every individual tweet document to determine whether the followers_count value is greater than or equal to 5,000.  The followers_count values are not sorted in any way, so there is no shortcut available to.  To fix this, simply add an index on the followers_count field.  It takes a while to generate the index, and the index itself takes up some additional space on disk, but it will vastly improve the response time for this query:\n",

    "Once the index is ready, execute the query again and it should return results much faster.  You can see that the database first conducts an index scan (\"IXSCAN\") to split the tweets into those that were tweeted by users with >= 5,000 followers, and those that were tweeted by users with < 5,000 followers.  This process only takes a few hundred milliseconds.  Then, the database performs a fetch operation (\"FETCH\") to actually read the tweets and return them to the results list.  This fetch process takes substantially longer than the index scan operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mongo Compass explain plan with index](img_mongodb/mongodb_explain_plan_with_index.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, with an index in place, the database is able to sort through the tweets extremely fast, and the time it takes to return results is largely dependent on the number of results being returned in the fetch operation.  (To convince yourself of this, try substituting a followers_count of `100000`, rather than `5000` and see the difference in performance that occurs when the number of results being returned is much lower.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates an important tradeoff in MongoDB and document-based databases.  The data load process is often very easy and quick in document-based databases, but the data itself is relatively unstructured behind the scenes.  Without a specific pre-defined data structure--some kind of a data model or indexed table working behind the scenes--it can be tricky to query data efficiently without some additional effort.  It is common, then, to have to generate indexes to help sort the documents based on some key attributes of interest before performing queries within a document-based database."

Fortunately, MongoDB allows you to set up a **text index** that enables full-text search across multiple fields at once.  The [MongoDB documentation on text search](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/) explains: \"a collection can only have one text search index, but that index can cover multiple fields.\"  So, let's set up an index that combines all of the important open-ended text fields in the data: the tweet 'text' field, the 'user.description' field and the 'place.full_name' field.  Run the following from the mongo shell to create the index.  This may take a minute or two to complete:\n",

    "Notice the escape syntax (ex: `\\\"minnesota\\\"`) in the search string above.  The `\\\"` surrounding each search term is what tells MongoDB to conduct a search that requires both Minnesota AND coffee to be in the result.  If you want to search for Minnesota OR coffee, you can simply use `\"minnesota coffee\"` as your search string, and the search will return results that have one term or the other, but not necessarily both.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important limitation of text indexes like this one is that they acts as \"special indexes\" that cannot be combined with complex spatial queries that require their own special indexes.  The MongoDB documentation on the [text query operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/text/) explains: \"You cannot combine the \\$text expression, which requires a special text index, with a query operator that requires a different type of special index.
