We also want to do our best not to load duplicate data when adding data to the database, and indexes can help with this.  When loading in data, we will ask Neo4j to check for any duplicates of tweets, users, places, or hashtags that may be present prior to loading in new records.  If it encounters a tweet that is already present in the database, Neo4j can skip over this tweet and avoid loading a redundant record.  In order to check for duplicates, however, Neo4j first needs to search through all of the existing records on each record load to see what's already present in the database.  This search and insert process goes _much_ more quickly if data is pre-sorted using indexes.  \n",

For the first 20 files, you can see that the load time increases at a linear rate, with each file taking consistently longer to load.  For the last 20 files, you can see that the load time immediately drops after the addition of the indexes and stays more consistently flat, regardless of how many additional files we load.\n",

If you are familiar with relational query languages like SQL, you may notice some slight similarities when it comes to high-level operators.  For example, the `RETURN` clause in Cypher is like the `SELECT` clause in SQL, and the `WHERE` clause is present in both query languages.  Much of the rest of the structure is quite different, however.  A basic query in Cypher is structured using the following operators, in the following order:\n",

    "LIMIT <maximum number of results to return>\n",

Parentheses `()` will match a node, and arrows and brackets `-[]->` will match a relationship.  Inside the parentheses, you can specify the type of node you want to search for--in this case, `(:Place)`.  You can also assign an arbitrary variable name--in this case, `p`--to use throughout the rest of the query to indicate this type of node.  Inside the brackets of a relationship, you can specify the relationship type--in this case, `[:LOCATED_AT]`.

    "#### Query: What is the shortest path between Britney Spears and Donald Trump, based on users' mentioning behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, the data model in our Neo4j database is set up so that `(t:Tweet)` nodes can have a `[:MENTIONS]` relationship that connects them to `(u:User)` nodes.  There is not, however, a direct user-to-user link between users who have mentioned each other, without first having identify specific tweets.  In order to answer the question above, it would be really helpful to extend the `[:MENTIONS]` relationship so that it can connect user nodes directly to other user nodes, instead of always having to go through tweets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Neo4j makes it relatively easy to adjust the data structure to add new relationships between nodes.  So, let's make a quick adjustment to the `[:MENTIONS]` relationship.  If a user creates a tweet that mentions another user, let's add an additional `[:MENTIONS]` relationship between the user and their mentionee. This is something we could have added to the original data model when importing the data, but it's not a problem to add this new relationship later on.  Run this query to add a `[:MENTIONS]` relationship between users and each of their mentionees:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH (u1:User)-[:TWEETED]->(t:Tweet)-[:MENTIONS]->(u2:User)\n",
    "WHERE u1 <> u2\n",
    "MERGE (u1)-[r:MENTIONS]->(u2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, use the shortestPath() algorithm to find mention patterns between users that link Britney Spears and Donald Trump:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH path = shortestPath((u1:User)-[:MENTIONS*..10]-(u2:User))\n",
    "WHERE u1.screen_name = \"britneyspears\"\n",
    "AND u2.screen_name = \"realDonaldTrump\"\n",
    "RETURN path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the `[:MENTIONS*..10]` syntax above allows a variable-length path of up to 10 degrees of mention separation between Britney and Trump.  Also notice that this query will match users who mention _or were mentioned by_ other users; i.e. it doesn't force a directional constraint on the `[:MENTIONS]` relationship, and the path between users can go in either direction.  This dataset is relatively small, so it doesn't contain anywhere close to a full approximation of mentioners and their mentionees.  Because of this, it will generally only return results when there is no directional constraint on the `[:MENTIONS]` pattern we are trying to match.  In a larger dataset, you may be able to add a directional constraint (ex: `(u1:User)-[:MENTIONS*..10]->(u2:User)`) to force a specific direction for the `[:MENTION]` relationship."

    "#### Query: Which users appear to be the most influential, based on how many mentions they've received?\n",
    "\n",
    "For this query, we can take advantage of a popular algorithm called PageRank that is implemented in the Neo4j graph algorithms library.  The Neo4j documentation describes the [PageRank algorithm](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/page-rank/) as follows: \"PageRank is named after Google co-founder Larry Page, and is used to rank websites in Googleâ€™s search results. It counts the number, and quality, of links to a page which determines an estimation of how important the page is. The underlying assumption is that pages of importance are more likely to receive a higher volume of links from other pages.\"  The algorithm operates similar to a search engine ranking; we can set up a query so that users who receive lots of mentions--and who receive mentions from other who _themselves_ receive lots of mentions--will surface as the most influential.  Run the following query to see which of the Twitter users present in our sample data appears to be the most influential, based on the quantity of their mentions and the caliber of their mentioners:\n",
